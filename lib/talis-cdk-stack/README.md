### TalisCdkStack

A base stack on top of the default CDK Stack on which to build a custom Talis App CDK Stack, provides helper methods and variables for referencing commonly used components including environment based removal policies and vpc resolution.

```ts
const app = new cdk.App();
const props: TalisCdkStackProps = {
  deploymentEnvironment: TalisDeploymentEnvironment.TEST,
};
const stack = new TalisCdkStack(app, "my-stack", props);

// Get the removal policy for the stacks environment
// Returns a CDK Removal Policy
stack.getRemovalPolicyForTalisDeploymentEnvironment(
  props.deploymentEnvironment,
);
```

It also adds the following tags to all taggable resources created within the construct:

- tfs-app
- tfs-environment
- tfs-release
- tfs-region
- tfs-service

The values of the tags are resolved from the TalisCdkStackProps passed to the construct.
